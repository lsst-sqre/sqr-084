# Using Times Square for observatory reporting

## Abstract

```{abstract}
Times Square is a SQuaRE service that supports parametrized non-interactive notebook execution. Although primarily developed for other purposes, it has the potential to be of use in generating periodic (eg nightly) observing reports. This technote describes the capabilities of this toolchain, advantages and limitations of this approach, and future development that if prioritized, could address some of those limitations.
